Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe (or noughts and crosses) is a simple strategy game in which two players take turns placing a mark on a 3x3 board, attempting to make a row, column, or diagonal of three with their mark. In this homework, we will use the tools we've covered in the past two weeks to create a Tic-Tac-Toe simulator and evaluate basic winning strategies.
Players soon discover that best play from both parties leads to a draw. Because of the simplicity of Tic-Tac-Toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer program to play Tic-Tac-Toe perfectly, to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity), or the 26.830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space.
